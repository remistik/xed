        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">1<sup>st</sup> life lesson from Moses<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
        <p class="lead">In Exodus chapter 2 verse 16-21, we read “<i>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock. Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock. When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?” They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.” “And where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.” Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.</i>"<br>
          <br>
          These six verses might seem insignificant compared to all Moses achieved, but I think it teaches us two important lessons. Moses helped the daughters and even protected them, although he had not even been asked to and there seemingly was no personal interest for Moses to do so. But in result of this completely selfless act, after a bit of time he gets to eat for free and even gets married. So, these verses teach us that if we are selfless and put other people’s need before ours, people likely will see it and thank us. But also, it shows that if we see people acting selflessly, we should always reward them. We should not act like the daughters, who did not thank Moses, but more like the father of the daughters, who remembered to reward him. I can easily relate to that. For example, at home if I help my parents or siblings, not only does it raise their mood because they got helped, and my mood because I did something good, but they are also more likely to reciprocate.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">2<sup>nd</sup> life lesson from Moses<span class="text-muted"> </span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Moses’ life teaches two other important lessons, which are to put all your trust in God and to understand that you do not have to be incredibly powerful, rich or intelligent to be chosen by God to do important things, you just have to be selfless. For much of his life, Moses was just a farmer. But one day, God chose him to be his prophet and to be the one who liberates the enslaved Israelites from Egypt. Moses at the start did not believe that he was capable of doing all that. He kept questioning God, he did not think he would be able to convince the Israelites or the pharaoh. But throughout his life, God’s prediction of Moses doing amazing things became true, and at the end of his life Moses went from being a farmer to having accomplished myriads of miracles to save Israelites.<br><br>
          So, Moses’ life teaches us to have full trust in God because He is always right. Moses life’s also makes us understand that God choses us to do important things for Him by our selflessness, not our richness or smartness. We just have to be selfless, in the way Moses was when he helped and protected farmers watering their flock. I can relate to this story because I know I have to put trust or faith in people around me, such as my parents. I cannot just keep questioning and doubting that they are doing the right thing for me: I just have to believe they are. I can also relate to this lesson because I know that to be great in my parent’s view, I do not have to be rich or powerful, but I just have to be selfless: for example, helping and being nice to people around me, at home or Saint Kentigern College.</p>

              <h2>Definition of a hero</h2>
              <p style="font-size: medium; text-align: justify;">Dictionary.com defines a hero as being “<i>a person noted for courageous acts or nobility of character</i>”. I chose this definition because it is closest to what I think is a hero: anyone who does many more brave and selfless acts than selfish acts. Going by those two definitions, a hero can be someone that has done wrong and evil things, but in total has done much more good than bad. This is why it is important to look at all of someone’s life to decide if he or she is a hero. We cannot just pinpoint one heroic or evil act in someone’s life and deduce from it that all of his or her life is heroic or evil. This is why I looked at all the important heroic or evil acts of Moses’ life and then decided whether Moses is a true hero or zero by seeing if there are more selfless acts than selfish acts (many very good acts can compensate a very evil act). I would also like to add that I will not judge Moses by the result of his actions but rather by their intention.<br>
                <br>For example, if I discover that he completely accidentally killed someone, I would consider this as a much less evil act than if he had intentionally killed someone. In addition, I will say that following God’s order is always the right thing to do because God is always selfless. So, if Moses does something that seems evil because God asked him to do it, I will still consider that Moses is doing the right thing because God would always have had a just and morally acceptable reason to do such a seemingly evil act. I also believe that killing anyone, evil or not, is an evil act. But sometimes it is necessary for an even worse thing to happen. So, killing a dictator because it is the only way to prevent him or her to kill millions is I think morally acceptable, but killing a dictator just for revenge is selfish and unacceptable. Now that I have defined how I am going to judge Moses, I will go through all of his significant acts in chronological order and judge each one of them.</p>

              <h1>First Act</h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The first significant act that Moses carried out is an evil one: he committed murder, something which is prohibited by the ten commandments. Exodus chapter 2 verse 11 to 12 informs us of that, “<i>One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</i>”  This can be partly excused by the fact that the Egyptian Moses killed was himself committing a crime by beating Hebrews. But to stop the beating, Moses had another, much less evil option: he could have just knocked out the Egyptian and helped the Hebrews escape. Instead, Moses was probably revengeful and did the evil act of killing someone. </p>

              <h1>Second Act</h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The second significant act was a good one: Moses selflessly protected farmers. We know this from Exodus chapter 2 verse 16 to 17: “<i>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock. Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock</i>”. However, this was not an incredibly heroic act: Moses’ help did not dramatically change the daughters’ life for the better, it probably just saved them a few hours.</p>

          <div class="container">
            <div class="carousel-caption text-end">
              <h2>Third Act</h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium;">Another act was Moses doubting God. We know this from Exodus chapter 4 verse 10 to 14: “<i>Moses said to the Lord, “Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.” The Lord said to him, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the Lord? Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.” But Moses said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.” Then the Lord’s anger burned against Moses and he said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you.”</i>”<br>
                <br>
                Moses angered God by doubting Him of being able to make Moses speak well. I do not think it was incredibly sinful because talking to God is not everyday and so Moses was probably quite shocked and fearful of God (for example, Exodus chapter 2 verse 6 “<i>Then he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God</i>” tells us that Moses is fearing God) and so might have just been scared to accept God’s demand and then disappoint Him. I really do not think Moses intentionally angered God. </p>

              <h1>Fourth Act</h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">A heroic act was Moses bringing the Israelites out of Egypt, as it saved many lives from enslavement. Exodus chapter 12 verse 31 to 32, “<i>During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the Lord as you have requested. Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.</i>”, shows that Moses did succeed in liberating the Israelites from Egypt. However, to do that Moses had to kill a lot of Egyptians (by releasing the ten plagues of Egypt) to convince the pharaoh to release the Israelites, but because this was ordered by God, I think Moses still did the right thing. More than that, I think this act was very important as it saved the lives of thousands of Israelites. Even better, Moses, by doing this act, was also directly serving God. </p>

          <div class="container">
            <div class="carousel-caption text-end">
              <h1>Fifth Act</h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">When Moses saw that Israelites were worshipping a golden calf, he got so angry that he threw the newly created tablets holding the ten commandments down on the ground, breaking them. We know this from Exodus chapter 32 verse 19: “<i>When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.</i>”<br>
                <br>
                I think that was sinful act as those tablets were holy, and Moses should not have let his anger out of control. But at the same time, tablets can be rewritten, and he was right to feel angry about his own people believing in a non-existent idol. And after all, Moses was still just a human, and humans have emotions like anger. So, I do not think this sinful act was too important. </p>

              <h1>Moses was a Hero</h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">So, Moses sinned by killing an Egyptian, kindly protected shepherds, doubted God, broke the holy tablets holding the ten commandments and heroically brought the Israelites out of Egypt. I think that bringing Israelites out of Egypt saved so many lives from enslavement that it quite largely compensates for killing one person at the beginning of his life, him doubting God (because bringing the Israelites out of Egypt shows that he finally did what God asked him to do) and breaking the holy tablets of the ten commandments.<br>
                <br>
                So, yes, <b>Moses was a hero.</b>  </p>
